                <li>🐾Emotional support animals provide comfort and stress relief to people suffering from mental health
                    issues.</li>
                <li>🐾Dogs are the most common type of emotional support animal because they are good at gauging human
                    emotion and take well to special training.</li>
                <li>🐾Many other types of animals also make great emotional support partners–especially for people who
                    are allergic to or afraid of dogs.</li>
                <li>🐾An emotional support or therapy animal is not quite the same thing as a service animal, which
                    provides physical help to its owner.</li>
