                    <li>Emotional support animals provide comfort and stress relief to people suffering from mental health issues.</li>
                    <li>Dogs are the most common type of emotional support animal because they are good at gauging human emotion and take well to special training.</li>
                    <li>Many other types of animals also make great emotional support partners–especially for people who are allergic to or afraid of dogs.</li>
                    <li>An emotional support or therapy animal is not quite the same thing as a service animal, which provides physical help to its owner.</li>

            <p>For people suffering from mental health issues, emotional support animals are a great way to provide treatment and coping mechanisms. Sometimes this emotional support is necessary just to help people function normally, especially for anxiety, depression, and for learning disabilities. An emotional support or therapy animal is not quite the same thing as a service animal, which provides physical help to its owner. A therapy animal provides emotional support only.</p>

            <p>You don’t necessarily need to own a pet or a domesticated animal in order to get some emotional benefit from an animal. We allow you to meet and play with animals at our site. We also make regular visits to hospitals, schools, and nursing homes to help children, the elderly, or sick people cope with difficult circumstances.</p>
